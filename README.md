# Program-for-determining-prime-numbers
This program prompts the user to enter a number, then it calculates and prints the first 3 prime numbers after the user input number. It uses a nested loop to check if a number is prime or not. If a number is prime, it is printed and the count is incremented until 3 prime numbers are found after the input number
